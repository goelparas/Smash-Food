# Smash-Food

Smash Food  is the Microgame which i have Built so far with the help  of the Unitylearn.com

# What the game is all about ?

 The game is like the fruit ninja but their is no mobile phone anymore.
 You can play this in the Mac or Windows or linux standalone.
 It was the small project which took me around 4 days to built from scratch.
